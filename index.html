  <h1>Async Video Test</h1>
  <h2>Test vertical video block</h2>
  <h3>Below we should have an div that only appears on mobile (or non-pointer) portrait pages</h3>
  <div class="mobile-portrait-warning">
    <img src="TurnPhoneHorizontal.png" alt="Turn Phone Horizontal">
    <p>Because we'll be broadcasting your video in landscape (horizontal) format, we'll need you to also record your video in landscape (horizontal) format.  It looks like you are using a phone or tablet in portrait (vertical) format, please turn it horizontally to continue.</p>
    <p>If you aren't using a phone or tablet in portrait mode, or have any other difficulties, please <a href="https://andeye.com/contact/">Contact Us</a></p>
  </div>
  <h3>Next an element that appears on non-mobile and mobile landscape pages</h3>
  <div class="recorder">
    <p>Yay, Landscape is for Pros</p>
